           "[It] is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller,
           and notable for its extreme minimalism."

           "The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer."

           "It is not intended for practical use,
           but to challenge and amuse programmers."
